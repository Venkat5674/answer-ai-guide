      question: 'Explain the difference between correlation and causation.',
      sampleAnswer: 'Correlation measures the statistical relationship between two variables - how they tend to change together. Causation means one variable directly influences another. The key distinction is that correlation doesn\'t imply causation. For example, ice cream sales and drowning incidents are correlated (both increase in summer), but ice cream doesn\'t cause drowning. To establish causation, we need controlled experiments, temporal precedence, and elimination of confounding variables.',

      question: 'Describe a time when you had to present complex data insights to non-technical stakeholders.',
      sampleAnswer: 'I once analyzed customer churn data for executives who needed actionable insights. Instead of showing complex statistical models, I created a simple dashboard with three key metrics: churn rate trends, top risk factors, and potential revenue impact. I used storytelling techniques, starting with the business problem, showing clear before/after scenarios, and ending with specific recommendations. I avoided jargon and used analogies they could relate to.',

      question: 'Tell me about a time when a product feature failed. How did you handle it?',
      sampleAnswer: 'We launched a new onboarding flow that actually decreased conversion rates by 15%. I immediately gathered data to understand why - user session recordings showed confusion at a specific step. I quickly assembled a cross-functional team to identify the issue: unclear copy and too many required fields. We implemented a quick fix within 48 hours and A/B tested improvements. The experience taught me the importance of more thorough user testing and having rollback plans ready.',
